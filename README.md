# Cup Memory Game
Created by Aatalon Shan

A polished Java Swing memory game: briefly memorize the order of 6 coloured cups, watch them shuffle, then rebuild the exact order by clicking cup icons. Tracks attempts, elapsed time, and a persisted best time (high score).

#

üéÆ How to Play
* Memorize the initial cup sequence (shown once for ~3s).
* Watch a short shuffle animation.
* Click the cup buttons in the exact original order; each click adds an icon to Your Guess.
* Use Undo if you mis-click.
* When all 6 are chosen, hit Submit.
* Reset restarts with a fresh order and timer.

#

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Ideas
* Difficulty levels (more/less shuffle cycles, fewer reveal seconds)
* Sound effects and celebration animations
* Classpath-based resource loading (works inside JAR)
* Localized UI strings
* Detailed stats (average attempts, fastest 5 times)
